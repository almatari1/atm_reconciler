# ATM Reconciler
This repository shows the implementation of ATM reconciliation.

An ATM, also known as "Automatic Telling Machine", if not operated and owned by the bank itself, is usually managed by an ATM solutions company. In this business model, the ATM solutions company buys and owns the machines, and then signs a tri-party agreement with a cash-in-transit company and a bank, or a funding entity that provides the cash.



The [Data Structure & Algorithm Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?) on Coursera teaches algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems with about 100 algorithmic coding problems in any programming language of the student's choice.

The Specialization includes 6 courses, namely:

* Algorithm Toolbox
* Data Structure
* Algorithms on Graphs
* Algorithms on Strings
* Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
* Genome Assembly Programming Challenge



## Algorithm Toolbox
#### Big-O Notation
In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. Click [here](https://tinyurl.com/y9tzg6sh) for the article I wrote to illustrate the basics of this concept.
#### Greedy Algorithm
The basic pattern of a greedy algorithm starts with picking a safe choice to tackle the problem, check that the safe choice works, repeat and solve smaller problems (sub-problem) with safe choices of the same concept and finish when thereâ€™s no smaller problem anymore.

#### Divide & Conquer
#### Dynamic Programming
## Data Structures
#### Stack
An abstract data type that allows adding and removing data on a Last-In-First-Out(LIFO) basis. It can be implemented with an array or linked-list.
#### Queue
#### Tree
#### Heap
#### Priority Queue
#### Hash Table
